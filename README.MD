A simple example of implementing grpc service via protobuf and `protoc` tool. ðŸš€

## Running

### TODO :
* [x] create a simple service with necessary files and tools
* [ ] create a docker file and run server code from there
* [ ] write test cases to run everytime docker image is created to perform operations on whole service
* [ ] write github actions to Automate Tests on each merge to main branch
